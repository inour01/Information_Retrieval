all the queries for the system evaluation.

are not yet supported by newer versions of Python.
Please ensure you have the following libraries downloaded: NLTK downloaded and imported to
use the module punkt, Sentence-Transformers, Pytorch and gensim.
Then in your IDE of choice run the python program for each experiment names according to this
formatting: CSI_4107_Assignment_2_Exp_# , it will produce the results.txt according to each
experiment's specifications along with helper files that make re-running the program much faster
(Ex external storing the inverted index, the preprocessed documents, document embeddings,
query embeddings, etc.)
